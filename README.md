"Hunt the Wumpus", originally written by Gregory Yob in the mid-1970s, was an early text-based computer game written in BASIC. It was a simple hide and seek-style game that featured a mysterious monster (the Wumpus) that lurks deep inside a network of rooms. As a result of the availability of its ource code, the game has been ported to numerous programming languages and platforms. 

My version is written in Python (this one in Python 2.7, but I'll upgrade to Python 3.6 at a later date). Though the code found here was all written by me, this is not a completely original idea; the impetus was from Anthony Briggs' “Hello! Python” book, which I got from Manning Books - https://www.manning.com/books/hello-python.
